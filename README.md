# OUR HOUSE
## Find your local and federal representatives
This website will allow you to enter in your home address and find the people that represent your district.
Enter in your home address into the space provided and click 'FIND YOUR REPS.'
You will be presented with a list of office titles.
When you click a title it will drop down with the name, party, phone, address and a link to their .gov website.
Clicking on the address will dropdown a Google Map of the representative's office.
Clicking on the website link will bring you to the representative's government website.
We hoped to create a website that was clean, bright and fun to use.
We wanted to provide a place that might encourage people to become more politically active. 
Because when people are informed and people speak loud enough their representatives will listen.
